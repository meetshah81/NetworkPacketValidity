1. Illumio Coding Challenge

This is my Coding Challenge repository.

2. Testing

As it was a 60-minute challenge, it wasn't enough time to write the unit test cases for the application. But, I tested the application
for various edge cases and also for the data types and the issues to range out the given IP range in network rules was also out of time frame. Hope you understand!

3. Implementation

For this challenge, I decided to make run time efficient.I did it by creating a HashSet of NetworkRule object. The hashset would insert
all unique hashcodes according to the rules defined in networkrules.csv file. This leads to the insertion time complexity of O(n) in
hashset and search complexity of O(1).

4. Refinements

If the time would have permitted, I would have thought about implementing proxy design pattern to optimize it. Also, finding an optimal
time complexity would have been an utmost priority to think about.

5. Teams I would like to join are in the following prefernces - 

1. Platform team
2. Data team
